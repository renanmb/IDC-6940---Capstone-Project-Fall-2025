[@WHO2025]. If we are able to detection stroke early for those at increased risk is will be amazing for prevention and prompt intervention because stroke frequently happens quickly and can cause long-term neurological disability.  Clinicians and public health experts can measure individual-level risk and target high-risk populations for clinical management and lifestyle counseling by using data-driven risk prediction models.\n\nLogistic Regression (LR) is one of the most widely used approaches for modelling binary outcomes such as disease is present in human or not  [@sperandei2014understanding]. It extends linear regression to cases where the outcome is categorical and provides interpretable coefficients and odds ratios that describe how each predictor is associated with the probability of the event. LR has been applied across a wide range of domains, including child undernutrition and anaemia [@asmare2024determinants], road traffic safety [@rahman2021identification; @chen2024binary; @chen2020modeling], health-care utilisation and clinical admission decisions [@hutchinson2023predictors], and fraud detection [@samara2024using]. These applications highlight both the flexibility of LR and its suitability for real-world decision-making problems.\n\nIn this project, we analyse a publicly available stroke dataset that includes key demographic, behavioural, and clinical predictors such as age, gender, hypertension status, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), and average glucose level. These variables are commonly reported in the stroke and cardiovascular literature as important determinants of risk. Using this dataset, we first clean and recode the variables into appropriate numeric formats and then develop a series of supervised learning models for stroke prediction.\n\nLogistic Regression is used as the primary, interpretable baseline model, but its performance is compared against several more complex machine-learning techniques, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machine, k-Nearest Neighbours, and Support Vector Machine (radial). Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, AUC, and confusion matrices. The main objectives are to identify the most influential predictors of stroke and to determine whether advanced machine-learning models offer meaningful improvements over Logistic Regression for classification of stroke risk in this dataset.\n\n# Methodology\n\nThis part explains about our stoke dataset, variables, preprocessing steps, logistic regression formulation, and the machine-learning modelling framework used to compare classifiers.\n\nOur datset contains 5,110 observations and 11 predictors commonly associated with cerebrovascular risk. After cleaning missing and inconsistent entries (e.g., “Unknown”, “N/A”, or rare textual categories such as “children” and “other”), a final dataset of 3,357 individuals remained for analysis. The cleaned dataset is stored in the object **strokeclean**.\n\nRespose we get is in binary so logestic regression is the best approach to observe whether the patient has had **stroke=1** or not **stroke=0** [@hosmer2013applied; @james2021isl]\n\n**Variables**\n\nThe key predictors are listed below.\n\n| Variable              | Type                           | Description                   |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |\n| **age**               | Numeric                        | Age of the individual (years) |\n| **gender**            | Categorical (1=Male, 2=Female) | Biological sex                |\n| **hypertension**      | Binary (0/1)                   | Prior hypertension diagnosis  |\n| **heart_disease**     | Binary (0/1)                   | Presence of heart disease     |\n| **ever_married**      | Binary                         | Marital status                |\n| **work_type**         | Categorical (1–4)              | Employment category           |\n| **Residence_type**    | Binary (1=Urban, 2=Rural)      | Place of residence            |\n| **smoking_status**    | Categorical                    | Never/Former/Smokes           |\n| **bmi**               | Numeric                        | Body Mass Index               |\n| **avg_glucose_level** | Numeric                        | Average glucose level         |\n| **stroke**            | Binary outcome (0=No, 1=Yes)   | Stroke occurrence             |\n\nStroke is a highly unbalanced outcome variable:\n- Yes (stroke): about 5%\n- No (no stroke): around 95%\n\nBecause it is possible to achieve high overall accuracy by merely forecasting the majority class, this class imbalance directly affects model evaluation. Because of this, in addition to accuracy, we also concentrate on sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, AUC, and Youden's J statistic.\n\n**Dataset Prepration**\n\nTo guarantee model validity and stop data leakage, data preprocessing is performed. [@wang2014].\n\nAmong the steps were:\n\n- Elimination of non-predictive identifiers (patient ID)\n\n- Transforming categorical variables into dummy numerical representations\n\n- Managing uncommon or irregular categories (e.g., \"Other\" gender values handled as absent)\n\n- BMI, glucose, and age conversion to numerical\n\n- Rows with unintelligible labels (\"Unknown,\" \"N/A\") are removed.\n\n- Valid range and consistency verification\n\n- After recoding, missing values might be imputed or removed.\n\n- During splitting, stratified sampling is used to maintain the stroke/no-stroke ratio [@chen2020modeling].\n\n- The outcome stroke was defined as a factor with levels \"No\" and \"Yes\" in the cleaned dataset strokeclean.\n\nTo check sample performance, the data were split into training and test sets. For the baseline logistic regression model, a simple random 70/30 split was used. For the full machine-learning comparison, a stratified partition (via caret::createDataPartition) was applied to preserve the stroke/no-stroke ratio in both sets.\n\n**Logistic regression model**\n\nLet $Y_i$ denote the stroke status for patient $i$, where\n\n- $Y_i = 1$ if patient $i$ experienced a stroke  \n- $Y_i = 0$ otherwise.\n\nLet the predictor vector for patient $i$ be\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ip})^\\top,\n$$\n\nwhere the $p$ predictors such as age, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, BMI, and smoking status. \n\nThe logistic regression model specifies the conditional probability of stroke as\n\n$$\nP(Y_i = 1 \\mid \\mathbf{x}_i)\n= \\pi(\\mathbf{x}_i)\n= \\frac{\\exp\\big(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_{ip}\\big)}\n       {1 + \\exp\\big(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_{ip}\\big)}.\n$$\n\nEquivalently, the logit (log-odds) of stroke is modeled as a linear combination of the predictors:\n\n$$\n\\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi(\\mathbf{x}_i)}{1 - \\pi(\\mathbf{x}_i)}\\right)\n  = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_{ip}.\n$$\n\nHere, $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\\beta_j$ is the change in log-odds of stroke for a one-unit increase in predictor \n $x_j$, holding other variables constant.\n\nExponentiating $\\beta_j$ gives the odds ratio (OR):\n$$\n\\text{OR}_j = e^{\\beta_j},\n$$\n\n\nwhich represents the multiplicative change in the odds of stroke for a one-unit increase in $x_j$.\n\n**Model Estimation**\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p)^\\top$ denote the vector of\nregression coefficients. For independent observations, the likelihood of the data is\n$$\nL(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})\n= \\prod_{i=1}^{n}\n  \\pi(\\mathbf{x}_i)^{\\,y_i}\n  \\left[1 - \\pi(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\right]^{\\,1-y_i},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\pi(\\mathbf{x}_i) = P(Y_i = 1 \\mid \\mathbf{x}_i)$.\n\nThe **log-likelihood**   is\n\n$$\n\\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})\n= \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\n\\left[\n  y_i \\log\\big(\\pi(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\big)\n  +\n  (1 - y_i)\\log\\big(1 - \\pi(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\big)\n\\right].\n$$\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is the value of\n$\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ that maximizes $\\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$. In R, this optimization\nis carried out automatically using `glm(..., family = binomial)`\n\n\n\n**Machine learning models and evaluation**\n\nSix supervised models were fitted using the caret framework in order to determine whether more sophisticated methods may significantly enhance stroke classification:\n\n- Logistic Regression (LR)\n\n- Decision Tree (rpart)\n\n- Random Forest (RF)\n\n- Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM)\n\n- k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN)\n\n- Support Vector Machine with radial kernel (SVM-Radial)\n\nAll models used the same 70% training / 30% test split and a consistent cross-validation procedure to ensure fair comparison.\nTo guarantee a fair comparison, all models employed the same cross-validation process and a 70% training/30% test split.\n\n\n**Data Splitting and Model Fitting in R**\n\nThe cleaned dataset is stored in the object `strokeclean`, where the outcome variable is\n`stroke` (0 = No stroke, 1 = Stroke), and predictors include `age`, `hypertension`,\n`heart_disease`, `avg_glucose_level`, `bmi`, `smoking_status`, and others.\n\nFirst, the dataset is randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%) to\nevaluate out-of-sample performance, logistic regression model is then fitted on the training data:\n\n\nFrom this model, estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are computed as:\n\n\n\n**Model Predictions and Performance Measures**\n\nPredicted probabilities on the test set are obtained as:\n\n\nUsing a classification threshold $c = 0.5$, the predicted class for patient $i$ is\n\n$$\n\\hat{y}_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } \\hat{\\pi}_i \\ge c, \\\\\\\\\n0, & \\text{if } \\hat{\\pi}_i < c.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\pi}_i$ is the predicted probability of stroke for patient $i$.\n\n\n**Evaluation Metrics**\n\nModels were evaluated using standard clinical classification metrics:\n\n- Accuracy\n\n- Sensitivity (Recall)\n\n- Specificity\n\n- Precision\n\n- F1-Score\n\n- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve\n\n- Area Under the Curve (AUC)\n\nYouden’s J Statistic, Used to determine optimal classification threshold:\n\n$J = \\text{Sensitivity} + \\text{Specificity} - 1$\n\n\nThese metrics are widely used in stroke-risk modeling literature and as per article it is often used to find optimial classidfication threshhold. [@chen2020modeling].\n\n# Analysis\n\nBefore starting to generate predictive models, an exploratory analysis was conducted to understand the distribution, structure, and relationships within the cleaned dataset (N = 3,357). This step is crucial in rare-event medical modeling because data imbalance, skewed predictors, or correlated variables can directly influence model behavior and classification performance.\n\n\n**Distribution of Key Continuous Variables**\n\nHistograms were used to assess the spread of the primary numeric predictors (Age, BMI, and Average Glucose Level). These variables demonstrate clinically expected right-skewness, particularly glucose and BMI, consistent with published literature on metabolic and cardiovascular risk distributions.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ncont_long <- strokeclean %>% \n  select(\n    Age = age,\n    BMI = bmi,\n    `Average Glucose` = avg_glucose_level\n  ) %>% \n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nggplot(cont_long, aes(Value, fill = Variable, colour = Variable)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.25, linewidth = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Variable, scales = \"free\", nrow = 1) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Density\") +\n  #palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  scale_colour_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Interpretation of Key Continuous Predictors\n\n- **Age**\n  - Smooth distribution from late teen.\n  - Majority between **40–70**, is at high-risk .\n  - No extreme clusters → good continuous predictor.\n\n- **Average Glucose Level**\n  - Clear **right-skew** with a long tail above **200 mg/dL**.\n  - Indicates a small group with poor metabolic problem (likely diabetic).\n  - Highly relevant for heart and stroke-related risk.\n\n- **BMI**\n  - Compact distribution (~22–35) with few outliers.\n  - Less variation → weaker contribution compared to vascular predictors.\n  - Pattern aligns with medical proven BMI as influence in our regression results.\n\n\n**Distribution of Key Categorical Variables**\n\nBar charts help visualize population composition.

This suggests a borderline significant effect, but clinically important.\n\n- Heart disease (OR = 1.628, CI: 0.942–2.733)\nHeart disease increases stroke odds by about 63%, but the CI includes 1, implying the association is positive but not statistically strong in this dataset.\n\n- Average glucose level (OR = 1.004, CI: 1.000–1.007)\nHigher glucose levels are associated with slightly increased stroke risk. Though the effect is small, the CI indicates marginal significance, aligning with known metabolic risk patterns.\n\n- BMI (OR = 1.007, CI: 0.975–1.037)\nBMI shows almost no meaningful effect on stroke risk, and the CI overlaps 1.

Stroke was a rare outcome (about 5% of cases) in the final sample of 3,357 people that was analyzed after the data was cleaned and inconsistent or missing values were eliminated. In addition to reflecting actual epidemiology, this significant class disparity complicates classification, particularly when it comes to identifying the minority (stroke) class.\n\nAge, hypertension, cardiac disease, and raised average glucose levels are among the best predictors of stroke, according to the baseline logistic regression model. Smoking status substantially increased risk.  These variables were identified as significant risk factors by odds ratios significantly greater than 1 and confidence intervals that did not cross 1.  These results support the use of logistic regression as an interpretable tool for comprehending the relationship between particular risk variables and the likelihood of stroke and are in line with the clinical literature on cerebrovascular illness.\n\nThe logistic regression model performed reasonably well overall in terms of prediction; however, sensitivity for stroke cases was more constrained at the default 0.5 probability threshold, as would be expected with an imbalanced outcome.  The model clearly outperformed random guessing, according to the ROC curve and AUC values, but there was still space for improvement in terms of differentiating between stroke and non-stroke patients.  Youden's J statistic offers a method for selecting a different categorization threshold that enhances the ratio of sensitivity to specificity, which may be crucial in a screening setting when it is expensive to miss actual stroke cases.\n\nMore sophisticated models, such Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Machine, were able to attain somewhat higher AUC values than logistic regression in the machine-learning comparison, showing superior discrimination across a range of thresholds.  However, these increases in AUC came at the expense of decreased interpretability and were not always accompanied by significant increases in sensitivity at fixed cut-offs.  Logistic regression, on the other hand, offers precise odds ratios and confidence intervals that are simpler for public health professionals and doctors to understand when discussing risk and developing interventions.\n\nBecause of the severe class imbalance, sensitivity for stroke cases was extremely low (around 2%), meaning that the model almost never predicted “stroke = Yes” and therefore missed most true stroke cases.\n\nTo address this, the decision threshold was lowered from 0.5 to 0.2. At this cut-off, sensitivity increased from roughly 2% to about 22%, while specificity remained high at around 95%. Overall accuracy dropped slightly to about 91%, but balanced accuracy improved, indicating a more reasonable trade-off between detecting stroke cases and avoiding false positives. This threshold experiment illustrates a key practical point: for rare but serious outcomes such as stroke, it can be preferable to sacrifice some overall accuracy in order to reduce the number of missed high-risk individuals. In this setting, the logistic model is more appropriately viewed as a screening or risk-flagging tool rather than a definitive diagnostic rule.\n\nOverall, the findings show that relatively simple models built from routinely collected health indicators can meaningfully distinguish between individuals with and without stroke, even in the presence of substantial class imbalance. Logistic regression emerges as a strong, interpretable baseline, while tree-based ensemble methods provide incremental performance improvements at the cost of transparency. Future work could focus on external validation, calibration assessment, more sophisticated imbalance-handling techniques, and the inclusion of additional clinical or longitudinal information. These extensions would help move from proof-of-concept modelling toward robust, clinically usable tools for stroke risk stratification and targeted prevention.\n\n\n# References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n",
