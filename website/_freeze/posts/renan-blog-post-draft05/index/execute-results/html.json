Introduction\n\nStroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide and remains a major public health challenge [@WHO2025]. Because stroke often occurs suddenly and can result in long-term neurological impairment, early identification of individuals at elevated risk is critical for prevention and timely intervention. Data-driven risk prediction models enable clinicians and public health professionals to quantify individual-level risk and to target high-risk groups for lifestyle counselling and clinical management.\n\nLogistic Regression (LR) is one of the most widely used approaches for modelling binary outcomes such as disease presence or absence [@sperandei2014understanding]. It extends linear regression to cases where the outcome is categorical and provides interpretable coefficients and odds ratios that describe how each predictor is associated with the probability of the event. LR has been applied across a wide range of domains, including child undernutrition and anaemia [@asmare2024determinants], road traffic safety [@rahman2021identification; @chen2024binary; @chen2020modeling], health-care utilisation and clinical admission decisions [@hutchinson2023predictors], and fraud detection [@samara2024using]. These applications highlight both the flexibility of LR and its suitability for real-world decision-making problems.\n\nIn this project, we analyse a publicly available stroke dataset that includes key demographic, behavioural, and clinical predictors such as age, gender, hypertension status, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), and average glucose level. These variables are commonly reported in the stroke and cardiovascular literature as important determinants of risk. Using this dataset, we first clean and recode the variables into appropriate numeric formats and then develop a series of supervised learning models for stroke prediction.\n\nLogistic Regression is used as the primary, interpretable baseline model, but its performance is compared against several more complex machine-learning techniques, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machine, k-Nearest Neighbours, and Support Vector Machine (radial). Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, AUC, and confusion matrices. The main objectives are to identify the most influential predictors of stroke and to determine whether advanced machine-learning models offer meaningful improvements over Logistic Regression for classification of stroke risk in this dataset.\n\n<!-- \n⣿⣿⡇⢩⠘⣴⣿⣥⣤⢦⢁⠄⠉⡄⡇⠛⠛⠛⢛⣭⣾⣿⣿⡏\n⣿⣿⣿⡇⠹⢇⡹⣿⣿⣛⣓⣿⡿⠞⠑⣱⠄⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟\n⣿⣿⣿⣧⣸⡄⣿⣪⡻⣿⠿⠋⠄⠄⣀⣀⢡⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋\n⠘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣭⣓⡽⡆⡄⢀⣤⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋\n⠄⢨⡻⡇⣿⢿⣿⣿⣭⡶⣿⣿⣿⣜⢿⡇⡿⠟⠉\n⠄⠸⣷⡅⣫⣾⣿⣿⣿⣷⣙⢿⣿⣿⣷⣦⣚⡀\n⠄⠄⢉⣾⡟⠙⠶⠖⠈⢻⣿⣷⣅⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶⡆⠄⣤⡀\n⠄⢠⣿⣿⣧⣀⣀⣀⣀⣼⣿⣿⣿⡎⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣇⠄⠈⠁\n⠄⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢇⣎⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶\n⠄⠄⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢟⣫⣾⣿⣷⡹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⢮⣭⣍⡭⣭⡵⣾⣿⣿⣿⡎⣿⣿⣌⠻⠿⠿⠿⠟⠋\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣹⣿⣿⣿⡇⣿⣿⡿\n⠄⠄⣀⣴⣾⣶⡞⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣾⣿⡿ \n-->\n\n## 2. Methods\n\nThe binary logistic regression model is part of a family of statistical models called generalised linear models. The main characteristic that differentiates binary logistic regression from other generalised linear models is the type of dependent (or outcome) variable. @harris2019statistics A dependent variable in a binary logistic regression has two levels. For example, a variable that records whether or not someone has ever been diagnosed with a health condition like Stroke could be measured in two categories, yes and no. Likewise, someone might have coronary heart disease or not, be physically active or not, be a current smoker or not, or have any one of thousands of diagnoses or personal behaviours and characteristics that are of interest in family medicine.\n\nThe binary logistic regression algorithm below:\n\n$$ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}\\right) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\cdots + \\beta_{k}x_{k}$$\n\nWhere $\\pi = P[Y =1]$ is the probability of the outcome.\n\n\n- Logistic Regression\n- Decision Tree\n- Random Forest\n- Gradient Boosted Machine\n- k-Nearest Neighbors\n- Support Vector Machine\n\n### Assumptions\n\nBinary logistic regression relies on the following underlying assumptions to be true:\n\n* The observations must be independent.\n* There must be no perfect multicollinearity among independent variables.\n* Logistic regression assumes linearity of independent variables and log odds.\n* There are no extreme outliers\n* The Sample Size is Sufficiently Large. Field recommends a minimum of 50 cases. @field2024discovering Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant @hosmer2013applied suggest a minimum sample of 10 observations per independent variable in the model. Leblanc and Fitzgerald (2000) @leblanc2000logistic suggest a minimum of 30 observations per independent variable.\n\n\n\n<!-- \n⣿⣿⡇⢩⠘⣴⣿⣥⣤⢦⢁⠄⠉⡄⡇⠛⠛⠛⢛⣭⣾⣿⣿⡏\n⣿⣿⣿⡇⠹⢇⡹⣿⣿⣛⣓⣿⡿⠞⠑⣱⠄⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟\n⣿⣿⣿⣧⣸⡄⣿⣪⡻⣿⠿⠋⠄⠄⣀⣀⢡⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋\n⠘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣭⣓⡽⡆⡄⢀⣤⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋\n⠄⢨⡻⡇⣿⢿⣿⣿⣭⡶⣿⣿⣿⣜⢿⡇⡿⠟⠉\n⠄⠸⣷⡅⣫⣾⣿⣿⣿⣷⣙⢿⣿⣿⣷⣦⣚⡀\n⠄⠄⢉⣾⡟⠙⠶⠖⠈⢻⣿⣷⣅⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶⡆⠄⣤⡀\n⠄⢠⣿⣿⣧⣀⣀⣀⣀⣼⣿⣿⣿⡎⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣇⠄⠈⠁\n⠄⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢇⣎⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶\n⠄⠄⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢟⣫⣾⣿⣷⡹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⢮⣭⣍⡭⣭⡵⣾⣿⣿⣿⡎⣿⣿⣌⠻⠿⠿⠿⠟⠋\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣹⣿⣿⣿⡇⣿⣿⡿\n⠄⠄⣀⣴⣾⣶⡞⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣾⣿⡿ \n-->\n\n## 3.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\n**Dataset Description**\n\nThe **Stroke Prediction Dataset** @kaggle01 is a publically available dataset for educational purposes containing 5,110 observations containing predictors commonly associated with cerebrovascular risk. The dataset is composed of 11 clinical and demographic features and 1 feature which is **id** a unique identifier for the patient. The dataset has features including patient's **age**, **gender**, presence of conditions like **hypertension** and **heart disease**, **work type**, **residence type**, **average glucose level**, and **BMI**. This dataset is primarily intended for educational purposes as it shares a lot of similarities with the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) dataset but it is not as descriptive.\n\n| Feature Name       |

handling missing values, converting character (categorical) features into numerical codes, and removing the identifier column.\n\n<!-- TODO -->\nSo as part of data preprocessing we will be focused on establishing consistency and ensuring all variables are in a format suitable for predictive modeling. This process starts by systematically addressing non-standard representations of missing data. Specifically, all instances of the string values \"N/A\", \"Unknown\", \"children\", and \"other\" found across the dataset were unified and replaced with the standard statistical missing value representation, NA.\n\nThen we proceed with converting several character-based (categorical) features into numerical features, which is necessary for predictive modeling.\n\n<!-- TODO -->\n\nThe feature **bmi**, initially read as a character variable was first converted to a numeric data type and subsequently rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThe binary categorical features were encoded into numerical indicators. The feature **gender** was transformed so that **\"Male\"** was encoded to 1 and **\"Female\"** was encoded to 0, and the **ever_married** was transformed so that **\"Yes\"** encoded to 1 and **\"No\"** encoded to 0.\n\nFeatures with multiple categories were also numerically encoded into numerical indicators. The **work_type** feature had its categories encoded so that **\"Govt_job\"** = 1, **\"Private\"** = 2, **\"Self-employed\"** = 3, and **\"Never_worked\"** = 4. The **Residence_type** was encoded so that **\"Urban\"** = 1 and **\"Rural\"** = 2. Finally, the **smoking_status** feature was encoded into three numerical levels, those being **\"never smoked\"** = 1, **\"formerly smoked\"** = 2, and **\"smokes\"** = 3.\n\nAdditionally, the continuous numerical variables **avg_glucose_level**, **heart_disease**, and **hypertension** were explicitly confirmed as numeric data types, with the **age** feature also being rounded to two decimal places for consistency.\n\n<!-- TODO -->\nThe final stage of preprocessing involved removing the **id** column, which served only as a unique identifier and held no predictive value. This action left the dataset with 11 core predictors. The target variable, **stroke**, was then converted into a factor (a categorical data type in R) named **stroke1**, and its levels were explicitly labeled as $\\text{\"No\"} = 0$ and $\\text{\"Yes\"} = 1$. The entire process concluded with the removal of all remaining observations containing missing or inconsistent entries, resulting in the creation of the final, clean data frames, **strokeclean** and **fourassume**.\n\n\n**Dataset Preprocessing Conclusion**\n\nThe **Stroke Prediction Dataset** @kaggle01 that started containing 5,110 observations and 12 features.

This strongly suggests **age is a critical risk factor for stroke**.\n\nThe majority of patients do not have **hypertension** and the proportion of stroke cases (blue bar) is visibly much higher in the group with **hypertension**. This indicates that **hypertension is a strong risk factor for stroke**.\n\nSimilar to hypertension, the majority of patients do not have **heart disease** and the proportion of stroke cases (blue bar) is visibly much higher in the group with **heart disease**. This indicates that **heart disease is a very strong risk factor** for stroke, even stronger than hypertension when based alone on the observed proportions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d\n# (a) Histogram of gender \n# (b) Histogram of Age\n# (c) Histogram of hypertension\n# (d) Histogram of heart_disease\nggarrange(p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, \n          ncol = 2, nrow = 2, \n          common.legend = TRUE, legend = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..count..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(count)` instead.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can observe from the histograms (e), (f), (g) and (h) the following: \n\nThe stroke rate appears higher for those who have ever been married which is a fascinating plot that catches our attention, this must be correlated with another variable. Our guess is that having been married being associated with a higher stroke risk in this dataset, is possibly due to the married group skewing toward older ages\n\nAcross the four work types encoded, \"Govt_job\" = 1, \"Private\" = 2  \"Self-employed\" = 3, \"Never Worked\" = 4. **Self-employed** individuals appear to have the highest risk proportion among the working groups. Followed by the **Private** which is the largest group (total $\\approx 2200$) and naturally accounts for the highest raw count of stroke cases (109) with a proportion of stoke incidence sligthly higher than **Govt_job**.\n\nThe stroke outcomes based on the patient's **residence type** has a very similar raw count their proportions seems to be similar as well. This suggests that **residence type** does not appear to be a significant factor for stroke risk.\n\nFrom the distribution of **average glucose** (HbA1c) we can visually spot that the stroke cases are more frequent for high-glucose relative to the total population at those high levels. This higher propportion indicates that **high average glucose (HbA1c) level is a significant risk factor** for stroke.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# p1e p1f p1g p1h\n# (e) Histogram of ever_married\n# (f) Histogram of work_type\n# (g) Histogram of Residence_type\n# (h) Histogram of avg_gloucose_level\nggarrange(p1e, p1f, p1g, p1h,\n          ncol = 2, nrow = 2, \n          common.legend = TRUE, legend = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can observe from the histograms (i) and (j) the following: \n\nFor the BMI distribution we can observe that the majority of the patient population (pink bars) falls within the overweight to obese range (BMI $\\approx 25$ to $35$). So as a consequence we can expect that the frequency of stroke cases (blue bars) will follow the distribution of the overall population, meaning most strokes occur where the largest number of people are located which are the BMI values between $25$ and $35$.\n\nHowever, we can visually spot that the stroke occurence is drops significantly closer to a healthy BMI of 20. So although the risk of stroke does seem to be generally higher than average once BMI exceeds the ideal range and moves into the overweight and obese categories because there is a larger distribution within the overweight to obese range, we can conclude that because the skewed distributin that **BMI is a significant risk factor predictor for stroke**.\n\nThe stroke outcomes are compared across the three smoking status categories encoded: **smokes = 3**, **formerly smoked = 2**, and **never smoked = 1**.\n\nThis plot is highlights a particularly interesting aspect of this dataset. The highest proportional risk of stroke appears to be in the **formerly smoked** group. This finding is common in medical literature @oshunbade2020cigarette, as individuals who have a history of smoking may have accrued vascular damage that persists, but their stroke risk is still lower than the risk for current smokers if they continue to smoke. \n\nThis information is importante, because the **formerly smoked** group shows the highest rate, suggesting that **a history of smoking is a significant indicator of risk.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# p1i p1j\n# (i) Histogram of bmi\n# (j) smoking_status\nggarrange(p1i, p1j,\n          ncol = 2, nrow = 1, \n          common.legend = TRUE, legend = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### **3.2.3 Correlation Analysis**\n\nTo assess the relationships between predictors and check the assumption of no perfect multicollinearity for Logistic Regression, a correlation matrix was computed and visualized for the clean dataset.\n\nThe correlation matrix reveals:\n\n- A strong positive correlation between age and ever_married ($\\approx 0.65$), which supports the histogram observation that older individuals are more likely to have been married.\n- Moderate positive correlations between hypertension and age, heart_disease and age, and avg_glucose_level and age.

Conclusion\n\nThis experiment compared a conventional logistic regression model with several machine-learning algorithms and examined whether common demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics may be used to predict stroke risk using a stroke dataset. Stroke was a rare outcome (about 5% of cases) in the final sample of 3,357 people that was analyzed after the data was cleaned and inconsistent or missing values were eliminated. In addition to reflecting actual epidemiology, this significant class disparity complicates classification, particularly when it comes to identifying the minority (stroke) class.\n\nAge, hypertension, cardiac disease, and raised average glucose levels are among the best predictors of stroke, according to the baseline logistic regression model. Smoking status substantially increased risk.  These variables were identified as significant risk factors by odds ratios significantly greater than 1 and confidence intervals that did not cross 1.  These results support the use of logistic regression as an interpretable tool for comprehending the relationship between particular risk variables and the likelihood of stroke and are in line with the clinical literature on cerebrovascular illness.\n\nThe logistic regression model performed reasonably well overall in terms of prediction; however, sensitivity for stroke cases was more constrained at the default 0.5 probability threshold, as would be expected with an imbalanced outcome.  The model clearly outperformed random guessing, according to the ROC curve and AUC values, but there was still space for improvement in terms of differentiating between stroke and non-stroke patients.  Youden's J statistic offers a method for selecting a different categorization threshold that enhances the ratio of sensitivity to specificity, which may be crucial in a screening setting when it is expensive to miss actual stroke cases.\n\nMore sophisticated models, such Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Machine, were able to attain somewhat higher AUC values than logistic regression in the machine-learning comparison, showing superior discrimination across a range of thresholds.  However, these increases in AUC came at the expense of decreased interpretability and were not always accompanied by significant increases in sensitivity at fixed cut-offs.  Logistic regression, on the other hand, offers precise odds ratios and confidence intervals that are simpler for public health professionals and doctors to understand when discussing risk and developing interventions.\n\nBecause of the severe class imbalance, sensitivity for stroke cases was extremely low (around 2%), meaning that the model almost never predicted “stroke = Yes” and therefore missed most true stroke cases.\n\nTo address this, the decision threshold was lowered from 0.5 to 0.2. At this cut-off, sensitivity increased from roughly 2% to about 22%, while specificity remained high at around 95%. Overall accuracy dropped slightly to about 91%, but balanced accuracy improved, indicating a more reasonable trade-off between detecting stroke cases and avoiding false positives. This threshold experiment illustrates a key practical point: for rare but serious outcomes such as stroke, it can be preferable to sacrifice some overall accuracy in order to reduce the number of missed high-risk individuals. In this setting, the logistic model is more appropriately viewed as a screening or risk-flagging tool rather than a definitive diagnostic rule.\n\nOverall, the findings show that relatively simple models built from routinely collected health indicators can meaningfully distinguish between individuals with and without stroke, even in the presence of substantial class imbalance. Logistic regression emerges as a strong, interpretable baseline, while tree-based ensemble methods provide incremental performance improvements at the cost of transparency. Future work could focus on external validation, calibration assessment, more sophisticated imbalance-handling techniques, and the inclusion of additional clinical or longitudinal information. These extensions would help move from proof-of-concept modelling toward robust, clinically usable tools for stroke risk stratification and targeted prevention.\n\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⠤⠖⠈⠉⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠢⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⠏⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⢦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⣠⠞⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠞⠋⢙⣦⡈⣷⡄⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⣀⠶⠁⠀⠀⣀⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡴⠁⠀⠀⠿⢿⡟⣌⢿⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⣠⡿⠀⢠⣜⠉⠀⠀⠙⢷⢄⠀⠀⠀⢧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⡆⢧⡀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⣯⠃⠀⢾⣿⠗⠀⠀⠀⠀⡽⠀⠀⠀⠈⠳⢄⣀⠀⠀⠀⡰⠃⠘⣵⡄ -->\n<!-- ⡏⠀⠀⠘⡄⠀⠀⠀⣠⠞⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⢱⡇ -->\n<!-- ⡅⠀⠀⠀⠙⠒⠔⠚⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡇ -->\n<!-- ⣧⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡗ -->\n<!-- ⡿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣇ -->\n<!-- ⠹⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠷⣤⣤⣤⣤⠞⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣸ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠸⣇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⠇ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⢇⠳⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡏⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠈⠀⠀⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n\n### References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣤⣒⢋⡤⣹⣯⣴⣤⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡔⠉⣽⣿⣿⣦⣉⣿⣯⠉⠴⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡸⠀⠆⠿⠻⠻⠟⠿⠿⢟⣶⡄⢹⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣣⠏⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⠇⠘⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡾⠀⠐⢀⠤⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡞⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⡞⡁⠀⠀⠉⠀⠀⠀⠐⠂⠄⢸⡿⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⢿⠂⠀⠀⠀⠠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⡻⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⢶⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢻⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡼⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠸⢇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣀⡀⠴⠙⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡠⢢⣿⣷⣤⢀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⡔⠈⣡⣄⡄⠀⠀⠲⠛⠂⠀⠀⠀⠈⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣷⣶⣯⣀⣒⡤⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⣠⡐⣉⣤⣶⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠂⠐⠀⠀⠀⢠⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣾⣵⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣛⡀⠀⠀⠠⢄⣀⣐⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡯⠤⠀⢇⣘⡒⠲⢾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣥⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⢀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⣓⠀⢰⠤⢭⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡧⠬⠀⢘⣛⣓⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⣒⠐⡷⠬⢭⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣭⡁⣛⣓⢲⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⠉⠛⠛⠛⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡶⢲⠦⢭⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣅⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀ -->\n<!-- ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣹⣛⣒⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧ -->\n<!-- ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠿⠾⠬⣭⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣤⣄⠀⠀⠙⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢼ -->\n<!-- ⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⠛⠋⢋⠁⠀⠀⠀⣶⢗⣛⣻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶⣾⣿⣿⡿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣾ -->\n<!-- ⠀⣿⣿⣿⣷⣾⣿⠀⠀⠁⠀⠀⣸⡆⠾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣯ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆⠀⠤⠄⣰⣿⡇⣭⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⠋⠁ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠺⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡿⢹⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡸⢡⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⢹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣷⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -->\n<!-- ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢨⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣄⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠀ -->\n",
