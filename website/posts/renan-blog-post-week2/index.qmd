This week I review 2 articles

## Article 1

[From Logistic Regression to the Perceptron Algorithm: Exploring Gradient Descent with Large Step Sizes](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.08424). @tyurin2024logisticregressionperceptronalgorithm

The author presents some interesting findings that by connecting Logistic regression with gradient descent there is a link with the perceptron algorithm. With really large steps it acts like a perceptron which in some sense links it back to the Deep Equilibrium networks study.
This paper is interesting because it is counter intuitive and brings a lot of things to reflect about classification and optimization theory.

## Article 2

[Large Language Model Confidence Estimation via Black-Box Access](https://huggingface.co/papers/2406.04370). @pedapati2025largelanguagemodelconfidence

This paper addresses the problem of estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs when only black-box (query-only) access is available. It is a simple technique that uses Logistic Regression to classify and validate the confidence of the outputs. The problem of using the black-box models is that there is no control over the model itself, but in some cases the benefits and the value of buying these services that provide a black-box model outweighs training your own custom so this is a framework that attempts to overcome the challenges.
